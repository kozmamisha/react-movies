While not as skeptical about love as Tracy, Emma is romance-shy in still feeling the sting from her latest break-up in believing at the time that her now-ex could have been the one if it wasn't for the long-distance circumstance. All they know about the veil is that it was featured in a late nineteenth-century painting by artist Amici. Starting at the Italian lace center of Burano, Emma does discover the two-centuries-old family lace shop where the veil originated. Emma is also surprised to discover that the Italian man who she has constantly encountered while in Burano and whom she felt was following her was more the opposite in he being Paolo Listetto, the next generation in that lace-making family. While Paolo's family can only tell Emma about the veil's origins and its appearance in the painting, they don't know anything about the intervening time to today and how the veil made its way to San Francisco where Emma and her friends purchased it. On behalf of his family, Paolo joins Emma in the quest to discover the veil's history, for Paolo to fill in the gaps for his own sense of family. While the power of the veil seems to be working on both Emma and by association widowed Paolo in they falling for each other, they will have to decide whether to act on that power in the geographic distance that exists in their everyday lives, including being separated by an ocean, and as Paolo is in a fight with his family about the direction of the business.",

Against the odds Bill escaped a bleak future in post-war, working class London to find himself at the very centre of a musical and cultural revolution. As a Rolling Stone he embarked on record-breaking world tours, dealt with feuding band mates and befriended some of the world's most iconic musicians, actors, sportsmen and artists. Then, to people's amazement he walked away from it all to commit to a new family and to set about documenting and preserving the memory of the 'rock and roll revolution'. Since leaving the Stones Bill has toured the world with his all-star band the Rhythm Kings as well as exhibiting his renowned photography. A keen archaeologist, Bill acts as a historical consultant on film and documentary projects and has written nine books on a variety of subjects. Throughout his career Bill shot hours of unseen film footage, took thousands of photographs, collected a vast archive of memorabilia and kept a detailed diary of each and every single day. Watching this footage and hearing the stories is like going back in time and standing at Bill's shoulder, experiencing this privileged access at first hand. The film uses his huge archive as the catalyst for stories about Bill's experience of wartime poverty, his love of blues music, the rise of the Rolling Stones, the 1960s counter culture, exile in France, his 1970s super groups, 1980s excesses and his life's work documenting and preserving the memory of such an important period of cultural and musical history.",
